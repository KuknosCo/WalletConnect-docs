# Kuknos WalletConnect 

## Introduction 
WalletConnect is an open protocol to communicate securely between Wallets and Dapps (Web3 Apps). The protocol establishes a remote connection between two apps and/or devices using a Bridge server to relay payloads. These payloads are symmetrically encrypted through a shared key between the two peers. The connection is initiated by one peer displaying a QR Code or deep link with a standard WalletConnect URI and is established when the counter-party approves this connection request. It also includes an optional Push server to allow Native applications to notify the user of incoming payloads for established connections.<br/><br/>


## Getting Started 
Currently the WalletConnect protocol has references implementations written in Typescript for the Client, Wallet and the Bridge Server. <br/><br/><br/>
To quickly setup your Dapp, go to the Quick Start section for **[code examples](quick-start/dapps/client).**<br /><br/>
To read in more detail about the WalletConnect protocol, go to **[Technical Specification](tech-spec)**<br/><br/>
